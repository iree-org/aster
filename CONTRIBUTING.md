# How to contribute

ASTER is a very young project that we are pre-releasing early to get exposure and
user feedback while collaborating in the open. For the next few weeks, expect a
lot of churn and evolution, before we can stabilize and start accepting PRs.

## Getting in touch

*   [GitHub issues](https://github.com/iree-org/aster/issues): Feature requests,
    bugs, and other work tracking
*   [ASTER Discord server](TBD): Daily development discussions with the core
     team and collaborators
